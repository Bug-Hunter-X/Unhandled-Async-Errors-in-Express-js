This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Express.js applications: unhandled errors within asynchronous operations. The bug.js file shows an Express server with an asynchronous operation that could potentially throw an error, but the error isn't properly handled, leading to a silent failure. The bugSolution.js file demonstrates how to fix this issue by using a proper error-handling mechanism.
